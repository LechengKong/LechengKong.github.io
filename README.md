# Bio

I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate at Washington University in St. Louis. I focus on studying and improving Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). My current target is to reduce the complexity of powerful GNNs. I am also interested in general ML and its clinical application. Recently, ICD auto-coding and multi-modal study using ICD code draw my attention.
