<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at Washington University in St. Louis. I focus on studying and improving Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). My current target is to reduce the complexity of powerful GNNs. I am also interested in general ML and its clinical application. Recently, ICD auto-coding and multi-modal study using ICD code draw my attention.

*Very recent interests on developing universal graph foundation model! Our preliminary work is [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00149). I am excited to talk about related ideas.*

I obtained my Bachelor's degree also from Washington University in St. Louis. It is my honor to be advised by Dr. Yixin Chen towards my Ph.D. degree. For details, check out my [CV](https://github.com/LechengKong/LechengKong.github.io/blob/main/docs/resume.pdf).


<h2>I am actively looking for internship Summer 2024. If you are interested in my work, I would love to chat and discuss potential opportunities.</h2>

# üî• News
- *2023.09*: Check out our newest work combining Graph Neural Networks with LLMs! ([Code](https://github.com/LechengKong/OneForAll), [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00149)) Using LLM, we design a GNN that is cross-domain (citation network, molecular graph, etc) and cross-task (node-level, link-level, zero-shot, etc), potentially serving as a pathway to graph foundation model.
- *2023.09*: &nbsp;üéâüéâ Two paper, [MAG-GNN](https://openreview.net/forum?id=K4FK7I8Jnl) and [(k,t)-FWL](https://openreview.net/forum?id=UlJcZoawgU) accepted by Neurips 23!
