<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate at Washington University in St. Louis. I focus on studying and improving Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). My current target is to reduce the complexity of powerful GNNs. I am also interested in general ML and its clinical application. Recently, ICD auto-coding and multi-modal study using ICD code draw my attention.

If you are interested in my work and would like to chat, shoot me an email!

I obtained my Bachelor's degree also from Washington University in St. Louis. It is my honor to be advised by Dr. Yixin Chen towards my Ph.D. degree. For details, check out my [CV](https://github.com/woodcutter1998/woodcutter1998.github.io/blob/main/docs/resume.pdf)
